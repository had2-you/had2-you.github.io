<span style="font-size:170%; font-weight:bold">이해주 | Anne</span>
</center>

<center>1998.03.31 Born in Republic of Korea 🇰🇷</center>
<br><br>
<center>Hey! 👋🏻 I'm Haeju Lee, an aspiring iOS developer who shares a passion for both coding and traveling. 👩🏻‍💻
<br><br>

I have a personality that does not settle for staying stagnant or lacking personal growth.<br>
I hold myself to high standards and strive for continuous improvement. <br>
Therefore, I am looking for a company that offers opportunities for growth and fosters a culture of learning and development. <br>
I am ready to put in the effort and dedication to learn and grow alongside the company. 🌱<br>

<br><br>

One of my hobbies and interests is traveling. ✈﹒﹒﹒🌏<br>
I discovered my love for traveling when I took a gap year at the age of 20 and went to Canada on a working holiday. <br>
Although I already enjoyed traveling before going on the working holiday, <br>
my one-year experience in Canada became a turning point in my life and shaped <u>who I am</u> today. :)<br>
<br>
Since then, I gained the courage to travel alone and had the opportunity to meet people from different countries, <br>
making friends and communicating in my second language, even if not fluently. <br>
<br>
Currently, I can only speak English fluently, but I have always been interested in learning other languages.<br>
As I traveled and met friends from various nations, my interest grew naturally. I have many Japanese friends now, <br>
and during my last vacation, I revisited Japan to meet the friends I made in Canada.<br>
Since then, I have been actively studying Japanese conversation.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I took up exercise as a hobby because, as a software major,<br>
I realized that I would be spending a lot of time in front of the computer. <br>
That's why I began a consistent fitness routine that included Pilates and yoga-like exercises for the past two years. <br>
Along the way, I started exploring different exercises and recently started learning tennis.<br>
<br>

Just like exploring new destinations excites me, delving into the world of iOS development sparks my curiosity.<br>
I believe that both endeavors require a similar mindset of continuous learning, adaptability, and a drive to discover new possibilities. <br>
By combining my love for technology and the thrill of traveling, I aim to create innovative and user-friendly experiences through iOS applications.<br>
Let's embark on this exciting journey together!<br>
<br><br>
